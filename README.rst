Cirq on IQM
###########

`Google Cirq <https://quantumai.google/cirq>`_ adapter for `IQM's <https://www.meetiqm.com>`_ quantum architectures.


What is it good for?
====================

Currently Cirq on IQM can

* take an arbitrary quantum circuit created using Cirq or imported from an OpenQASM 2.0 file
* map the circuit into an equivalent one compatible with the chosen IQM quantum architecture
* optimize the circuit by commuting and merging gates
* simulate the circuit using one of Cirq's simulators
* run the circuit on an IQM quantum computer


Installation
============

The recommended way is to install the distribution package ``cirq-iqm`` directly from the
Python Package Index (PyPI):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install cirq-iqm


Documentation
=============

The documentation of the latest Cirq on IQM release is available
`here <https://iqm-finland.github.io/cirq-on-iqm/index.html>`_.

Jump to our `User guide <https://iqm-finland.github.io/cirq-on-iqm/user_guide.html>`_
for a quick introduction on how to use Cirq on IQM.

Take a look at the `Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`_ with examples: ``examples/usage.ipynb``.
