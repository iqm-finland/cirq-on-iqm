    """The MOVE operation is a unitary population exchange operation between a qubit and a resonator.
    Its effect is only defined in the invariant subspace :math:`S = \text{span}\{|00\rangle, |01\rangle, |10\rangle\}`,
    where it swaps the populations of the states :math:`|01\rangle` and :math:`|10\rangle`.
    Its effect on the orthogonal subspace is undefined.

    MOVE has the following presentation in the subspace :math:`S`:

    .. math:: \text{MOVE}_S = |00\rangle \langle 00| + a |10\rangle \langle 01| + a^{-1} |01\rangle \langle 10|,

    where :math:`a` is an undefined complex phase that is canceled when the MOVE gate is applied a second time.

    To ensure that the state of the qubit and resonator has no overlap with :math:`|11\rangle`, it is
    recommended that no single qubit gates are applied to the qubit in between a
    pair of MOVE operations.

    Note: At this point the locus for the move gate must be defined in the order: ``[qubit, resonator]``.
