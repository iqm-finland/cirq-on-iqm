    The qubits are connected thus::

             |
      QB2 - QB3 - QB4
             |
            QB5

    where the lines denote which qubit pairs can be subject to two-qubit gates.

    Each qubit can be rotated about any axis in the xy plane by an arbitrary angle.
    Adonis thus has native PhasedXPowGate, XPowGate, and YPowGate gates. The two-qubit gate CZ is
    native, as well. The qubits can be measured simultaneously or separately once, at the end of
    the circuit.
