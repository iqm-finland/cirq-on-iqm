class Apollo(IQMDevice):
    r"""IQM's twenty-qubit transmon device.

    The qubits are connected thus::

            QB20  QB17
            /  \  /  \
         QB19  QB16  QB12
         /  \  /  \  /  \
      QB18  QB15  QB11  QB7
         \  /  \  /  \  /
         QB14  QB10  QB6
         /  \  /  \  /
      QB13  QB9   QB5
         \  /  \  /  \
         QB8   QB4   QB2
            \  /  \  /
            QB3   QB1

    where the lines denote which qubit pairs can be subject to two-qubit gates.

    Each qubit can be rotated about any axis in the xy plane by an arbitrary angle.
    Apollo thus has native PhasedXPowGate, XPowGate, and YPowGate gates. The two-qubit gate CZ is
    native, as well. The qubits can be measured simultaneously or separately once, at the end of
    the circuit.
