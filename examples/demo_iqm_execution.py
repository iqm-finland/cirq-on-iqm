Demonstrates executing a quantum circuit on an IQM quantum computer.

Set the IQM_SERVER_URL environment variable before running this script.
Also, if the server you are running against requires authentication you will also have to set
IQM_AUTH_SERVER, and either IQM_TOKENS_FILE or both of IQM_AUTH_USERNAME and IQM_AUTH_PASSWORD.

E.g.

    export IQM_SERVER_URL="https://example.com/cocos"
    export IQM_AUTH_SERVER="https://example.com/auth"
    export IQM_TOKENS_FILE="/path/to/my/tokens.json"
